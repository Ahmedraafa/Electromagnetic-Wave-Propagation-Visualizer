# Electromagnetic Waves Project

## 1. Introduction
Electrical waves are based on simple scientific ideas that show how electricity and magnetism work together to create waves and help them move from one place to another. Today, because technology is everywhere, understanding these waves is very important. They are the basic components for antennas, communication systems, electronic devices, and even new energy technologies.

## 2. Definition
Electromagnetic waves are vibrations of electric and magnetic fields that carry energy and information through space—without the need for any physical medium like wires.  

- A changing electric field creates a magnetic field and vice versa.  
- The electric (E) and magnetic (H) fields are perpendicular to each other and to the wave’s direction of travel.

Electromagnetic waves cover a wide frequency range, from low-frequency radio waves used in wireless communication to high-frequency gamma rays.  

| Property         | Description       |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Higher energy    | Shorter wavelength |
| Lower frequency  | Longer wavelength |

## 3. Electromagnetic Wave Propagation Modes

### 3.1 Ground Propagation
- Radio waves travel along the Earth’s surface, following its curvature.  
- Works best at low and medium frequencies.  
- Enables communication beyond the visual horizon.  
- Commonly used in maritime and AM radio transmissions.  
- Waves can bend around obstacles.

### 3.2 Sky Propagation
- Radio waves are transmitted toward the sky and reflected (refracted) back to Earth by the ionosphere.  
- Enables long-distance communication.  
- Works best in the high-frequency (HF) range (3–30 MHz).  
- Used for international broadcasting, shortwave radio, and military communication.  
- Waves cannot bend around obstacles.

### 3.3 Line-of-Sight Propagation (LOS)
- Typically occurs at frequencies above 30 MHz.  
- Requires a clear path between the transmitter and receiver; signals travel in straight lines.  
- Some obstacles partially block or weaken the signal.  
- Atmospheric conditions affect signal strength.  
- Used in VHF, UHF, and microwave communications.

## 4. Relationship Between Frequency and Wavelength
- Speed of light in air: `C = 3 × 10^8 m/s`  
- Frequency: `F = C / λ`  
- Wavelength (`λ`) is inversely proportional to frequency.  
- High-frequency gamma rays result from short wavelengths.

## 5. Relationship Between Frequency and Energy
- Planck constant: `h = 6.626 × 10^-34 Js`  
- Energy: `E = h × F` or `E = c × h / λ`
